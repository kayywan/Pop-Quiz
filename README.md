# Pop-Quiz

This has been one of the more challenging assignments to do.  While the general framework of the quiz was more or less figured out, it was the computer logic that has proven to be where most of the challenge resides in.  Sadly, most of the Javascript has not been inputted, as most of the struggle had been in figuring out the computer logic, listing what steps, statements and functions I would be using to perform basic operations such as deducting time off the counter.  

I look forward to revisiting this challenge with a better understanding and greater confidence in regards to JavaScript and JQuery.
